## Short description
Me, responsible for zero carbon in 2050, saving Mother Earth.

### What's the problem?

    Carbon emission plays a major role in global warming which in turn results in climate change. Global data has proved this and we are experiencing in our daily life. Multiple carbon offset solutions are being proposed across the globe in resolving this  rapid increase in carbon emission, since Industrial revolution. Global nations have pledged and started working hard towards net zero emission by 2050. 	
    Trees play major role in absorbing carbon from atmosphere and storing carbon in soil, thus improving its fertility. Dense trees in forest also helps in seasonal monsoons that helps agriculture. Several studies prove that deforestation has played major role in climate change. For example, we living in Tamil Nadu observe several cyclones and failure of seasonal monsoon which has badly affected our agriculture due to deforestation in Western ghats.
    Though Bhutan has already reached their net zero emission,the climate of Bhutan is greatly affected because of its neighbourhood countries like China and India, that are leading in carbon emission. The responsibility of planting trees must be met in where there is emission. Its easily understood that rather than planting trees in Bhutan, doing so in India and China will save Bhutan in turn. 
    Several global and voluntary organizations have taken up responsibility in planting trees across nations. However, the planted tree count couldn’t match with the tremendous increase in carbon emission. Understanding the need of the time and the emergency, we propose this solution of 'Mr. Me', (Me responsible.Mother Earth) to distribute the responsibility of achieving net zero emission by 2050 to every individual and entity of our Earth. Me as individual person, family, factory, organization, institution, nation must be responsible for the count of trees associated with our own carbon emission. This technology solution implemented in Cloud with artificial intelligence and machine learning along with open source support will help in predicting and estimating the number of trees required to achieve net zero emission by 2050 by every individual entity on Earth by identifying the factors that are responsible for their carbon emission . 
    This application will also help them in identifying their major source of carbon emission and hence can inspire them in considerable reduction in usage of carbon emission factors like food consumption especially beef, flights, fuel vehicles, products associated with fossil fuel usage etc. Responsibility to take care of our own tree count will be cost effective and easily realizable solution. Its scalable and implementable by every Government across the Globe according to their jurisdiction.
    A simple analogy could be that every nation has ‘tax collection’ enforced throughout nation and so can be a ‘tree plantation’ enforced as the responsibility of citizens. Every carbon emission contributor must realize their responsibility in planting trees along with reducing their carbon emission factor working towards their net zero emission. This will help us achieve global results faster.
Me, responsible for zero carbon in 2050, saving Mother Earth.

### How can technology help?

Global data storage, retrival and predictive analysis is best done with Open source and Cloud technology especially with artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### The idea

Every entity on Earth participating in carbon emission is equally responsible for its reduction towards net zero for a safe planet with favourable climatic condition ensured to every species on Earth.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Long description

[More detail is available here](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md)

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

It's in a free tier IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the future we plan to run on Red Hat OpenShift, for example.

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.
